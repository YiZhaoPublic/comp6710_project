You can use a map of the store or create a list of items you need to purchase. It's also helpful to use a white cane or guide dog to help you navigate the store.\n\nWhen you enter the store, start by looking for the section that contains the products you need. You can use your senses of hearing and smell to help you locate specific items. For example, if you need snacks, you can listen for the sound of the snack aisle or use your sense of smell to detect the scent of snacks.\n\nAs you move through the store, make sure to keep your white cane or guide dog in a visible location, such as on your belt or in your hand. This will help you avoid any obstacles or people who may not be aware of your needs.\n\nIf you need help finding a specific product, don't hesitate to ask a store employee for assistance.
